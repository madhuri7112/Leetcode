The thought process behind the solution to an algorithmic problem

Paradigms

| Paradigm | Concept | Examples |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| Two pointer approach | Use two pointers for the array and move the pointers based on some decission | --- |
| Sliding window | Similar to two pointer approach but usually the window (distace between two pointers) is fixed and the window is moved in a direction based on some decission |
| Use array as position array | use index of the array to flag the value of index | used in finding duplicates in array etc |
